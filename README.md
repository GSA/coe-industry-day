## A significant step forward

To accelerate the process, OAI centralized subject matter expertise, best practices, and access to the latest technology into the [CoEs](https://coe.gsa.gov/), housed within the [GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/)â€™s [Federal Acquisition Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service)'s (FAS) [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS). Our efforts started with [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/).

## The Centers
With a [clear mission](https://coe.gsa.gov/mission/) in mind, the CoEs will provide agencies with support in the following areas:

1. **[Cloud Adoption](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/cloud-adoption/)**
2. **[Contact Center](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/contact-center/)**
3. **[Customer Experience](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/customer-experience/)**
4. **[Data and Analytics](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/data-analytics/)**
5. **[IT Infrastructure Optimization](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/it-infrastructure/)**

## Where things stand
With Phase 1 [well under way](https://coe.gsa.gov/updates/), the CoEs are now looking to implement a variety of the recommendations that have arisen through our [human-centered design](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/HCD-Discovery-Guide-Interagency-v12-1.pdf) and user-focused research. We are working hard to begin Phase 2 before the end of Fiscal Year 2018.
