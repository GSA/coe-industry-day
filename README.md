# Centers of Excellence

## Phase II - Industry Day and Reverse Industry Days

* **Who:** The [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE) teams from the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) and the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) (USDA) along with you, our industry partners.

* **What:** An opportunity for government and industry to share ideas and learn from one another. We encourage participation through questions, comments, and recommendations prior to the event, which you can submit as [Issues](https://github.com/gsa/coe-industry-day/issues) in this repository.
    * At our **Industry Day**, we'll discuss the number and scope of our anticipated procurements, the proposed acquisition strategies, and provide updates on our progress. Please see [our agenda](https://github.com/GSA/coe-industry-day/blob/master/assets/CoE-Agenda.pdf) for additional details.
    * At our **Reverse Industry Days**, industry partners should provide [a one-page fact sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/bSySmePLyr0CCSMa2) on the capabilities you have to provide a solution for [the specific procurement/group](assets/CoE-Requirements.pdf) you're meeting with. The [fact sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/bSySmePLyr0CCSMa2) can address your previous experience that is directly related to that procurement/group, and recommend ways to improve what we ask for in the solicitation we end up posting -- _we're not looking for any marketing information_.

* **Where:** Industry Day will be held at [GSA NCR Auditorium](https://goo.gl/maps/ucatYSZg6NF2) (7th and D St SW, Washington, DC 20410 -- the entrance for the public is on D St) with the Reverse Industry Days taking place on the first floor at various rooms in the [GSA Central Office](https://goo.gl/maps/TvCrGn41Vgm) (1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405 -- please use the F Street entrance, **NOT** the New York Avenue entrance or any other entrance).

* **When:** The Industry Day will be on June 27, 2018, from 1:00pm to 3:00pm EDT. The Reverse Industry Days will be in pre-reserved 25-minute blocks on June 28 and June 29, 2018, from 9:00am to 5:00pm EDT on both days. You do not need to be available for the entirety of both Reverse Industry Days, only for the blocks you are participating in. Please show up at least 15 minutes early for the events you attend.

## A significant step forward

In 2017, the White House [Office of American Innovation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-announces-white-house-office-american-innovation-oai/?utm_source=link) (OAI) [collaborated with CEOs from the largest IT companies in the U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/american-technology-council-summit-modernize-government-services/) to identify [key areas](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Administration-2017-ST-Highlights.pdf) where the government could gain maximum efficiency and cost savings through IT modernization. It was decided to centralize subject matter expertise, best practices, and access to the latest technology from private industry into five distinct [CoEs](https://coe.gsa.gov/), housed within the [GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/)â€™s [Federal Acquisition Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service)'s (FAS) [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS). We started our efforts in April 2018 with [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/) as our "lighthouse" agency.

## The Centers

In accordance with [our mission](https://coe.gsa.gov/mission/), the [CoEs](https://coe.gsa.gov/) are supporting [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/) in the following areas:

1. **[Cloud Adoption](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/cloud-adoption/)**
2. **[Contact Center](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/contact-center/)**
3. **[Customer Experience](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/customer-experience/)**
4. **[Data and Analytics](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/data-analytics/)**
5. **[IT Infrastructure Optimization](https://coe.gsa.gov/centers-of-excellence/it-infrastructure/)**

## Where things stand

In [Phase I](https://coe.gsa.gov/updates/) of our work with USDA, we put in place an approach built around [human-centered design](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/HCD-Discovery-Guide-Interagency-v12-1.pdf) and [user-focused research](https://playbook.cio.gov/). In Phase II, we hope to implement recommendations that arose in Phase I as a result of that approach. We hope to begin Phase II before the end of Fiscal Year 2018.
